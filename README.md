## ⚙️ Technical Interests

### 🧠 Generative AI (Gen AI)
I’m fascinated by the creative power of generative models, particularly in how they can produce human-like text, images, and more. I'm interested in their applications in content creation, automation, and intelligent systems.

### 🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)
As AI systems become more complex, transparency is crucial. I'm drawn to explainable AI techniques that make machine learning models more interpretable and accountable, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare and autonomous driving.

### ⚛️ Quantum Computing
Quantum computing offers a radical shift in computational power. I’m intrigued by how it could solve complex problems exponentially faster and how quantum principles apply to cryptography and AI optimization.

## 🗂️ Portfolio

### 1. 🚦 Traffic Rule GenAI
A prototype that uses generative AI to simulate responses and scenarios around traffic rule enforcement and public education. The model generates realistic driving prompts and explanations based on current legislation.

### 2. 📈 LSTM for Anomaly Detection in Autonomous Vehicles
Implemented an LSTM-based deep learning model to detect anomalies in sensor data collected from autonomous vehicle simulations. Focused on improving safety and response systems through early detection of unusual behavior.
